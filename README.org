* Intro
This is a collection of tools and classes for the Bs⁰ → DsK/Dsπ
analysis.  

_Studies:_
1. Bs⁰ time acceptance
2. Bs⁰ and bachelor particle opening angle as PID
3. Develop a multi-variate selection for Bs⁰ using TMVA.


* Classes
_Tree reader:_
+ Inherits from purely virtual =readTree=
+ =readDataTree= reads data ntuples
+ =readMCTree= reads Monte Carlo ntuples
+ =lifetime= reads Monte Carlo ntuples for lifetime acceptance studies
+ There are several overloaded =readTree::Loop()= methods for
  different types of output.

_Opening angle:_ 
+ =oangle= implements a DLL like PID variable using the D-meson and
  bachelor opening angle.


* Utilities
+ =accept.cc=: an utility to select events using the =lifetime= tree
  reader for lifetime acceptance studies
+ =resolution.cc=: make residual and pull plots from Monte Carlo
+ =ltFit.py=: fit for the trigger lifetime acceptance function


* TMVA
The =tmva/= directory has a whole sleuth of scripts to train and apply
MVA classifiers, and to make corresponding plots.  For some of the
plotting, it uses the [[https://github.com/suvayu/rplot][rplot]] library.  It also uses =numpy= here and
there.
